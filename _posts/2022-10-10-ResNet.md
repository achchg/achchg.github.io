I recently found a paper regarding time-series forecasting: [N-BEATS](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.10437.pdf) and found myself missing a few pre-requsite concept. One of them was the use of classic residual network algorithm, first proposed as [ResNets](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.03385.pdf). Here are some of my learning notes:

#### ResNets
A residual neural network ([ResNet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Residual_neural_network)) is a deep neural netword architecture, which uses skip connections/shortcuts to jump over some layers (usually 2-3 layer skips) to avoid the problems of:
- 1) **vanishing/exploding gradients**: gradients becoming too small or big when increasing layers, and
- 2) **degradation**: deeper NN has larger training/testing error. 

ResNets contain typical NN characteristics of adding nonlinearities (ReLU) and batch normalization in between the layers. Note that the residual ($$F(x)$$) of a residual block will be add to an identity matrix ($$x$$) before passing on to the ReLU activation function.

    </div>
</div>

Why it solves the 2 problems above? 
- If considering a NN above, then $$ F(x) + x = a^{[2]} = g(z^{[2]} + x) = g(w^{[2]} a^{[1]} + b^{[2]} + x)$$.
- To solve the above equation by minimizing $$F(x)$$ as 0, we'd get $$a^{[2]} = x \approx g(x)$$, where we expect $$w^{[2]} \approx 0$$ and $$b^{[2]} \approx 0$$ so as $$w^{[l]}$$ and $$b^{[l]}$$ at earlier layers (l).
