Hello! I am Chi, a data science leader with over 10 years of experience in both the academic and industry worlds. I'm a hands-on type, so I love diving into projects and getting things done.

My quantitative strengths lie in statistics and machine learning (including experimentation methodologies, value metric designs, productionalization of machine learning models on realtime A/B testing platform, uplift modeling, bayesian statistical modeling, etc.). Most recently, I have been expanding my tech specs into natural language processing, deep learning and LLMs.

Iâ€™m experienced in leading data science teams and digital product development, and here are some examples:
- experimentation + ML personalization (e.g. omnichannel, content, timing optimization)
identifying higher-value customer segments with propensity and uplift scores
- python-based campaign performance measurement framework development with frequentist/bayesian methods
- customer profiling (e.g. defining patient cohort with ICD-10 code logics and machine learning)
- software development (front + backend) of forecasting models (rule-based + ML-based) on a cloud platform
- generative AI agents R&D with LLMs and retriever augmented generation (RAG)


During graduate studies, I was an environmental health researcher and biostatistician at Harvard focused on environmental pesiticide exposure and health risk simulation with statistical models. My doctoral [dissertation](https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/37945631/CHANG-DISSERTATION-2018.pdf?sequence=3) was about linking sub-lethal pesticides exposure to honeybee colony collaspe disorder (CCD) and human health with novel biomarkers.
